## Projects for Term 1

### Candyland Game 10/22/25 (created new theme to be a candyland theme instead of a space theme)

This is a fun Candyland-themed game based on a space game. You control a cookie/ice cream spaceship flying through the sky full of sweets like cottton candy, lollipops, and candy apples.

The goal is to avoid hitting the candy obstacles. If your spaceship collides with any candy, you lose health, if your health gets to 0 the game ends. The game gets harder as more candy appears and moves faster.

You can collect power-ups like ammo boost or a health boosts to help you survive longer and get a higher score. It's a colorful, fun game that's easy to play and great for all ages.

## Projects for Term 2

### Echoes of the Maze ( group project)

#### In this game you will wander through dark corridors collecting spooky coins. The goal is to grab as many coins as possible and find the exit, but the maze is filled with creepy obstacles that can appear out of nowhere. It’s easy to play but hard to shake the feeling that something might be following you.
